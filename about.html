                  Our club was founded in 1960 by a small group of old Ford enthusiasts. Present membership level is about 50. This is by no means a "good old boys" club; 
                  we encourage family activities. Our sole purpose is the enjoyment of one common theme - the pleasure that we receive from working on, cruising in, 
                  and showing our Model A’s & T’s. In order to be a member in the club, you do not have to own an old car or have any technical knowledge of the old designs. 
                  You simply need to have an interest in early Fords.
                  <br /><br />
                  We have a business/social meeting on the third Tuesday of each month at the Golden Corral in Fort Walton Beach, FL, consisting of a social hour and dinner 
                  at 6:00 and a business meeting at 7:00. The business meeting is primarily a discussion of recent, current, and future events of the club, and is usually 
                  followed by an informal chat session about car problems and light technical matters. The meetings are usually finished by 8:00.
                  <br /><br />
                  We have a warm relationship with several local car clubs, and share many of our events with them as well, including shows, cruises, cookouts, and show & 
                  shines.
                  <br /><br />
                  As a rule, many of our members congregate on Saturday morning for breakfast at Denny's in Shalimar, FL. Afterwards, the members often head over to to Jess 
                  Holmes' auto shop for a technical session conducted by Jess or another member. Jess is one of our founding members and is quite active in the club. Also, as 
                  a professional, he has a tremendous amount of technical knowledge from his many decades of experience.
                  <br /><br />
                  In the spring and fall of the year there are many car shows in the surrounding areas, sometimes several in a single weekend. We typically try to go as a group 
                  and are proud to display our cars and socialize with attendees. Our club, along with two other car clubs, manage an annual local car show held on the second 
                  weekend in September at the Mullet Festival grounds in Niceville, FL. This show usually has 120 plus entries along with food and craft vendors. Our club 
                  donates at least 51% of the proceeds from that show to charity, with the remainder serving as our only source of income aside from membership dues. We 
                  traditionally pick a few local charities to contribute to.
                  <br /><br />
                  Membership dues are $10 per year to those who can receive all correspondence by internet. For those who do not have internet access, and must be mailed 
                  information, we ask that they pay $20 per year to help cover the extra cost of printing and postage.
                  <br /><br />
                  If you own, are looking to own, or even just have an interest in Henry Ford’s early ladies, look us up at a local automobile event or stop by and join us at 
                  one of our monthly meetings. We would love to meet and chat with you to share some of our early Ford knowledge, or better yet, learn something new from you!
                  <br /><br />
                  The Northwest Florida Model A & T Ford Club was chartered by the Model A Ford Club of America (MAFCA) on October 7, 1960, and by the Model T Ford Club 
                  International (MTFCI) in 2008. Both the MAFCA and the MTFCI clubs are national societies dedicated to the restoration and preservation of their respective 
                  models. Both clubs have bi-monthly magazines and are a wealth of knowledge on early Fords. All members are encouraged to join these national clubs.
