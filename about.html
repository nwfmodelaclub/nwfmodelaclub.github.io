                  Our club was founded in 1965 by a small group of old Ford enthusiasts, some of whom still are still active members. Present membership level is about 50; most are couples.
                  This is by no means a "good old boys" organization; we encourage family activities.  Our sole purpose is the enjoyment of one common theme - the pleasure of ownership,
                  working on, and frequently local cruising in our ancient gems. To enjoy membership in the club, one does not have to own an old car or have any technical knowledge
                  of the old designs, but simply have an interest in the oldies.<br /><br />We have a business/social meeting the third Tuesday each month at the Golden Corral in Fort Walton
                  Beach, consisting of a social hour and dinner at 6:00 and a business meeting at 7:00. The business meeting is primarily a discussion of recent, current and future events of
                  the club, usually followed by an informal chat session about car problems and light technical matters. The meetings are always finished by 8:00.<br /><br />Traditionally, we
                  have had an annual steak barbecue, a Christmas season party and a few "ice cream socials". We share a warm relationship with the local Playground Antique and Classic Car Club
                  (PACCC) with whom we share many of our events, including the Christmas party and the cookouts.<br /><br />Once per month, we and the Playground club enjoy a cruise-in to one of
                  the local drive-in restaurants such as Sonic, to enjoy bull sessions with folks who may drive by and stop to see our cars and socialize a little. As a rule, many of our members
                  congregate on Saturday morning for breakfast at Denny's, frequently going from Denny's to Jess Holmes' auto shop for a technical session conducted by Jess or another oldtimer.
                  Jess is one of our original members and is quite active in the club, and as a professional, has a font of technical knowledge from his many decades of experience.<br /><br />In
                  the autumn and spring of the year, there are many car shows in the area, sometimes several in a single weekend. We are proud to display our cars and compete for trophies,
                  usually making a good showing. Our club, with two modern car clubs, Corvette and Mustang, annually manage a local show that draws entries from as far as New Orleans, Birmingham
                  and Tallahassee. Our proceeds from that show are our sole source of income other than membership dues. We traditionally contribute more than half of the proceeds to local
                  charities.<br /><br />Membership dues are $10 per year. To cover the extra cost of printing our monthly newsletter, members who do not have an Internet connection are asked to
                  pay an additional $ 10 annually.
